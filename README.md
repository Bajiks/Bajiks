### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniel Bajik.

Former Accountant, evolved into an adaptable and analytical Data Scientist (maybe a Python Backend Developer too). 

Enjoying the road as a Data Science Bootcamp Teacher at <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/uikit/logo.png" alt="lw" width="30" height="30"/></a>

Proven expertise in identifying business needs, planning data-driven solutions, developing predictive models and AI-driven insights, and supporting implementation processes.
